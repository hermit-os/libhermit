Complete all outstanding RMA operations at the given target. 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPI_Win_flush(int rank, MPI_Win win)
</PRE>
<P>
<tt>MPI_Win_flush</tt> completes all outstanding RMA operations initiated by the calling
process to the target rank on the specified window. The operations are
completed both at the origin and at the target.
<P>
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>rank </B><DD>rank of window (nonnegative integer)

<DT><B>win </B><DD>window object (handle)
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Thread and Interrupt Safety</H2>
<P>
This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be
safely used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided
thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically,
this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as <tt>malloc
</tt>or other non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
<P>
<H2>Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <tt>MPI_WTIME</tt> and <tt>MPI_WTICK</tt>) have
an additional argument <tt>ierr</tt> at the end of the argument list.  <tt>ierr
</tt>is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
<tt>call</tt> statement.
<P>
All MPI objects (e.g., <tt>MPI_Datatype</tt>, <tt>MPI_Comm</tt>) are of type <tt>INTEGER
</tt>in Fortran.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <tt>MPI_Wtime</tt> and <tt>MPI_Wtick</tt>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <tt>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</tt> (for communicators),
<tt>MPI_File_set_errhandler</tt> (for files), and <tt>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</tt> (for
RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <tt>MPI_Errhandler_set</tt> may be used but
its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler
<tt>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</tt> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <em>not</em> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
possible.
<P>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_SUCCESS </B> <DD> No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_RANK </B> <DD> Invalid source or destination rank.  Ranks must be between
zero and the size of the communicator minus one; ranks in a receive
(<tt>MPI_Recv</tt>, <tt>MPI_Irecv</tt>, <tt>MPI_Sendrecv</tt>, etc.) may also be <tt>MPI_ANY_SOURCE</tt>.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_WIN </B> <DD> Invalid MPI window object
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_OTHER </B> <DD> Other error; use <tt>MPI_Error_string</tt> to get more information
about this error code.
