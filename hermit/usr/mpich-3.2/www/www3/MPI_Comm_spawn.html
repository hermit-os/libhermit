Spawn up to maxprocs instances of a single MPI application 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPI_Comm_spawn(const char *command, char *argv[], int maxprocs, MPI_Info info,
                  int root, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Comm *intercomm,
                  int array_of_errcodes[])
</PRE>
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>command </B><DD>name of program to be spawned (string, significant only at root) 

<DT><B>argv </B><DD>arguments to command (array of strings, significant only at root) 

<DT><B>maxprocs </B><DD>maximum number of processes to start (integer, significant only 
at root) 

<DT><B>info </B><DD>a set of key-value pairs telling the runtime system where and how 
to start the processes (handle, significant only at root) 

<DT><B>root </B><DD>rank of process in which previous arguments are examined (integer) 

<DT><B>comm </B><DD>intracommunicator containing group of spawning processes (handle) 
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Output Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>intercomm </B><DD>intercommunicator between original group and the 
newly spawned group (handle) 

<DT><B>array_of_errcodes </B><DD>one code per process (array of integer) 
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Thread and Interrupt Safety</H2>
<P>
This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be
safely used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided
thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically,
this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as <tt>malloc
</tt>or other non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
<P>
<H2>Notes for Fortran</H2>
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for <tt>MPI_WTIME</tt> and <tt>MPI_WTICK</tt>) have
an additional argument <tt>ierr</tt> at the end of the argument list.  <tt>ierr
</tt>is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the
<tt>call</tt> statement.
<P>
All MPI objects (e.g., <tt>MPI_Datatype</tt>, <tt>MPI_Comm</tt>) are of type <tt>INTEGER
</tt>in Fortran.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <tt>MPI_Wtime</tt> and <tt>MPI_Wtick</tt>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <tt>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</tt> (for communicators),
<tt>MPI_File_set_errhandler</tt> (for files), and <tt>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</tt> (for
RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <tt>MPI_Errhandler_set</tt> may be used but
its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler
<tt>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</tt> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <em>not</em> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
possible.
<P>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_SUCCESS </B> <DD> No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_COMM </B> <DD> Invalid communicator.  A common error is to use a null
communicator in a call (not even allowed in <tt>MPI_Comm_rank</tt>).
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_ARG </B> <DD> Invalid argument.  Some argument is invalid and is not
identified by a specific error class (e.g., <tt>MPI_ERR_RANK</tt>).
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_INFO </B> <DD> Invalid Info 
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_ERR_SPAWN </B> <DD>
