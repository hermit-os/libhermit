Allocate a handle for a control variable 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPI_T_cvar_handle_alloc(int cvar_index, void *obj_handle, MPI_T_cvar_handle *handle, int *count)
</PRE>
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>cvar_index </B><DD>index of control variable for which handle is to be allocated (index)

<DT><B>obj_handle </B><DD>reference to a handle of the MPI object to which this variable is supposed to be bound (pointer)
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Output Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>handle </B><DD>allocated handle (handle)

<DT><B>count </B><DD>number of elements used to represent this variable (integer)
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Thread and Interrupt Safety</H2>
<P>
This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be
safely used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided
thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically,
this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as <tt>malloc
</tt>or other non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
<P>
<H2>Errors</H2>
<P>
All MPI routines (except <tt>MPI_Wtime</tt> and <tt>MPI_Wtick</tt>) return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
may be changed with <tt>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</tt> (for communicators),
<tt>MPI_File_set_errhandler</tt> (for files), and <tt>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</tt> (for
RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine <tt>MPI_Errhandler_set</tt> may be used but
its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler
<tt>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</tt> may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does <em>not</em> guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
possible.
<P>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_SUCCESS </B> <DD> No error; MPI routine completed successfully.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED </B> <DD> The MPI tool information interface is not initialized.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_INVALID_INDEX </B> <DD> Index is invalid or has been deleted.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE </B> <DD> The handle is invalid.
</DL>
<DL><DT><B>MPI_T_ERR_OUT_OF_HANDLES </B> <DD> No more handles available.
