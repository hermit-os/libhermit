# This shell script is no longer the canonical version number script, but rather
# a byproduct of running ./maint/updatefiles using maint/Version.base.m4 as
# input.  The real version info is contained in maint/version.m4 instead.  It is
# intentionally not managed by the makefile system and may not be up to date at
# all times w.r.t. the version.m4 file.
